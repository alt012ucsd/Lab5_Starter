1.) You would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. This is because there are many interconnected componenets, and moving parts related to sending a message. A unit test wouldn't be able to test the interactions between several components.

2.) I would use a unit test to test the "max message length feature, as its most likely scaled to a single component. There isn't any other interaction with other things, making a unit test suitable for ensuring the function works.
